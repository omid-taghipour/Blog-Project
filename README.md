<h1 align="center">Personal Blog Website </h1>

# Project Description

The Personal Blog Website is a dynamic website where users can create, edit, and publish blog posts. The website allows users to register and log in to their account, where they can create and manage their posts. The website also includes features such as approving or rejecting post by admins.

# Languages Used
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and PHP. Here is a breakdown of each technology's role in the website:

HTML: Used for the website's structure and layout. HTML is responsible for defining the website's elements such as headers, footers, navigation bars, and content sections.

CSS: Used for styling the website's elements. CSS is responsible for defining the website's visual design, such as font styles, color schemes, and layout. Mostly it is used with Bootstrap.

PHP: Used for the website's server-side functionality. PHP is responsible for handling user registration, login, and post creation. It is also responsible for processing user input and communicating with the website's database.

The website's main features include:

User Registration and Login: Users can create an account on the website by providing their name, email address, and password. Once registered, users can log in to their account to create and manage their blog posts.

Blog Post Creation: Logged-in users can create new blog posts by entering a title, and content.

Overall, the Personal Blog Website is a great project for anyone looking to practice their HTML, CSS, and PHP skills. The website's dynamic features and server-side functionality make it a challenging project that will provide a lot of learning opportunities.
